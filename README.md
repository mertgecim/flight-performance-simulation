# Flight Performance Simulation – Commercial Aircraft Mission Analysis

## Overview
This project presents the simulation of a complete mission profile including take-off, climb, cruise, and landing phases for three commercial aircraft using OPF-derived data. The aircraft were evaluated based on runway requirements, fuel efficiency, and mission constraints.
